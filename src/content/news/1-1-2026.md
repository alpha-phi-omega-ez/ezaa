# 2025 Convention

The fraternity celebrated it's Centennial at the 2025 National Convention in Philadelphia from December 27th-December 30th 2025. These are some updates related to the chapter and EZAA from the convention. EZAA also hosted a dinner with alumni at the convention in the area.

## Nowotny

The chapter submitted another incredible application and was awarded the [Dean Arno Nowotny National Service Award](https://apo.org/about-us/our-story/service-award-dean-arno-nowotny/) for the best service program since the last convention in 2023. This is the chapter's 7th Nowotny and the first time the chapter has received the award in back to back conventions. We are incredibly proud of the chapter for this achievement and for their continued efforts to produce the best service program in the country.

## 100 Member Chapter Challenge

The national fraternity put out a [challenge](https://apo.org/centennial/) to all chapters as the fraternity moved towards it's centennial to push for large member growth. The Epsilon Zeta chapter rose to the challenge and was awarded a certificate for growing the chapter's membership leading up to the centennial.

## Joseph Scanlon National Certificate of Merit

The chapter received the [Joseph Scanlon National Certificate of Merit](https://apo.org/about-us/our-story/apo-awards/scanlon-recipients/) in recognition of their membership growth. They achieved a net growth of 15% for a chapter with over 51 members.

## Congratulations to Epsilon Zeta brothers on their elections

Epsilon Zeta has a long-standing tradition of producing exceptional fraternity leaders. The EZAA is proud to announce that, at this year’s convention, two more alumni have joined this distinguished group, join us in congratulating Mike "Spreee" Haber and Jacob Tehranian.

### National Board

Mike "Spreee" Haber was reelected to the National Board as an at large board member.

### Region Chair

Jacob Tehranian was elected as Region Q chair overseeing all chapters in upstate New York.

## Relevant Legislation

The legislative body of the fraternity passed a number of proposals and policy updates, the National Fraternity will be releasing a full report on the changes soon. There are some changes that I wanted to highlight as they pertain to EZAA and general new policies in the fraternity.

### FIN-2A-17A

Allows alumni association annual fees from all alumni associations, previously it was only "local" organizations. The fee was also moved from the national bylaws to the fraternity operations and policy manual.

With this change the board has the power to set the annual alumni association fee, I expect this will lead to an increase to better support the fraternity. This will add a higher financial burden on EZAA, the board will handle this if the fee is changed.

### APR-1A-3R

This resolution directed the national office to publicize information nationally on alumni associations.

I expect this should hopefully help EZAA have more ways to publish information about us and hopefully get more EZ alum involved.

### Affiliate Membership

There was a proposal to create an affiliate membership type allowing non traditional members to join APO but this legislation did not pass

### Advisor Changes

Proposals to adjust the advisor structure for chapters. There is no longer an advisory chair and a requirement for 4 advisors. The new policies require 2 advisors; campus advisor which fulfills any duties related to the college campus and a Fraternity advisor that handles any duties related to the national office or fraternity as a whole. Restrictions on advisors were not included from committee; these originally included limits to how many and who could advise chapters.

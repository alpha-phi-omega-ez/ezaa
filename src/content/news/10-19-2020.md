EZAA is hosting an online event to celebrate 73 years of APO at RPI on Saturday, October 24, 2020. Join us to catch up with brothers and compare stories of what APO was like when you were in college and what you’ve been doing since graduation to live our principles of leadership, friendship and service.

A link to the Zoom call will be sent to anyone who RSVPs, so be sure to [let us know if you wish to attend](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMIxU36BsxHJNVYWY8JuEZShzD0T0537QS_BHMWtkwMPU3cQ/viewform).

### Schedule

- __10 a.m.–12 p.m. ET:__ Welcome and drop-in social hour. Feel free to join or leave the call any time during this window as we gather to catch up with each other and talk about APO and EZAA’s past, present, and future.
- __2 p.m. ET:__ Online service projects. We need your help to keep our alumni chapter moving forward. Help us reconnect with lost brothers and complete our photo archives by identifying unlabeled images. If you would like to help with either of these projects, but are unable to attend at this time, please email the [EZAA Extension Chair](mailto:apo.ezaa@gmail.com).

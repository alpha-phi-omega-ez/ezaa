    <p>The purpose of the EZAA is to keep the alumni of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of Alpha Phi Omega informed about the chapter's goings on, events, and ways to stay active by participating in service events.</p>
    <p>It is also a great way for EZ alumni to keep in touch. Every brother of Alpha Phi Omega who has left RPI is automatically a member, as are active brothers who are seniors or graduate students.</p>
